"""``nets/`` may import torch, the standard library, ``entmax`` and the sibling net layers.

The rule and its rationale live in ``teb_vae/lag_attn/tests/test_nets_are_framework_free.py``,
whose machinery is imported rather than restated, as the sibling model's own copy does. One
extension is needed: the shared ``_ALLOWED_ROOTS`` admits ``teb_vae`` wholesale -- necessarily,
since this package reuses ``teb_vae.lag_attn.nets`` and ``teb_vae.lag_attn_rws.nets`` -- and that
would wave through an import of any package's Lightning tasks, trainers, plotting, config loaders,
evaluation packages or test helpers. Those are forbidden by dotted prefix instead, on every package
in the family, so a net stays constructible without the framework around it.

The sibling's "the guard fires" self-test is deliberately not ported. It is proven there against
the same machinery; repeating it here would test the import, not this package.
