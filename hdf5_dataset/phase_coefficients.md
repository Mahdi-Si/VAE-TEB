Of course. Based on the code's logic and your parameters, here is a detailed breakdown of what each of the 78 channels in the phase and cross-channel phase correlation tensors represents.

### Setup and Interpretation Key

*   **Filters:** We assume 12 wavelet filters, `psi_0, psi_1, ..., psi_11`. They are ordered from **highest frequency** (smallest scale, `psi_0`) to **lowest frequency** (largest scale, `psi_11`).
*   **Channel Indexing:** The 78 channels are generated by iterating through pairs of filters `(psi_i, psi_j)` where the index `j` is always less than or equal to `i` (`j <= i`).
*   **Interpretation for `phase_corr` (Within-Channel):**
    *   **Autocorrelation `(i = j)`:** This measures the signal's **energy** in the frequency band of `psi_i`. It's a non-negative value indicating signal strength at that scale.
    *   **Phase Coupling `(j < i)`:** This measures the **phase coherence** between the higher-frequency component `psi_j` and a harmonic of the lower-frequency component `psi_i`. A consistently high value indicates a stable harmonic relationship.
*   **Interpretation for `cross_phase_corr` (Between-Channel):**
    *   **Cross-Correlation `(i = j)`:** Measures the phase coherence **between the two signals** within the same frequency band `psi_i`.
    *   **Cross-Phase Coupling `(j < i)`:** Measures the phase coherence between the **high-frequency component `psi_j` from one signal** and a **harmonic of the low-frequency component `psi_i` from the other signal**.

# Phase

Of course. Let's break down what each of the 78 phase coefficients represents, focusing specifically on the concept of **phase harmonics**, which is the core idea behind the `phase_corr` output.

### The Two Types of Phase Harmonic Coefficients

When `compute_phase=True`, the `phase_corr` tensor gives you two kinds of information about the signal's internal structure. The "phase harmonic" concept is central to the off-diagonal terms.

1.  **Energy Coefficients (Diagonal Pairs `i == j`)**:
    *   **What it represents:** This is **not** a harmonic coefficient. It is a measure of the signal's **local energy** or **power** within a specific frequency band `psi_i`. The phase information is removed by taking the magnitude squared, resulting in a measure of pure strength.
    *   **How to think of it:** "How much activity is happening in this specific frequency range?"

2.  **Phase Harmonic Coupling Coefficients (Off-Diagonal Pairs `j < i`)**:
    *   **What it represents:** This is the core "phase harmonic" feature. It measures if the phase of a lower-frequency component `psi_i` is evolving in a stable, proportional way to the phase of a higher-frequency component `psi_j`. A high value means the two frequency bands are not independent but are coupled in a harmonic-like relationship.
    *   **How to think of it:** "Is the rhythm of this lower frequency band locked to the rhythm of this higher frequency band?"
