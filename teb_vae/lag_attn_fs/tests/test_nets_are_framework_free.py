"""``nets/`` may import torch, the standard library, ``entmax`` and the sibling net layers.

The rule and its rationale live in ``teb_vae/lag_attn/tests/test_nets_are_framework_free.py``,
whose machinery is imported rather than restated. One extension is needed: the shared
``_ALLOWED_ROOTS`` admits ``teb_vae`` wholesale -- necessarily, since this package's model composes
a sibling's and reuses its objective outright -- and that would wave through an import of any
package's Lightning task, trainer, plotting, diagnostic page, config loader, evaluation package or
test helpers. Those are forbidden by dotted prefix instead, on every package of the family, so a
net stays constructible without the framework around it.

``sample_page`` joins the dotted ban rather than being covered by ``plotting`` alone: this
package's forecast rows live in ``lag_attn_fs/sample_page.py`` and import matplotlib, so a net
reaching for them would need a figure backend to construct. They are reached through the task's
``forecast_rows`` seam and nowhere else.

The "guard fires" self-tests are not ported: they are proven in the owning suite against the same
machinery, and repeating them here would test the import rather than this package.
