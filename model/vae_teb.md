# TEB-VAE Model Analysis

## Overview
The TEB-VAE (Target-Encoder-Bank Variational Autoencoder) is a sophisticated deep learning architecture designed for learning latent representations to predict future samples of multi-channel signals. The model uses a conditional encoding approach with dual-source inputs for enhanced representation learning.

## Architecture Components

### 1. SeqVaeTeb (Main Model)
**Purpose**: Orchestrates the entire TEB framework for sequence prediction with uncertainty quantification.

**Key Features**:
- Processes 76-channel input signals over 300 timesteps
- Predicts 30 future timesteps using learned latent representations
- Implements variational inference with KL divergence regularization
- Uses a warmup period of 60 timesteps for stable training

**Flow**:
1. Source encoder processes phase harmonic input (x_ph) ’ mu_x
2. Target encoder processes scattering transform (y_st) and phase harmonic (y_ph) ’ mu_y, logvar_y
3. Conditional encoder combines mu_x and conditional features ’ posterior distribution
4. Decoder generates future predictions from sampled latent z

### 2. SourceEncoder
**Purpose**: Encodes source phase harmonic signals into latent representations.

**Architecture**:
- Dual-path processing: Linear projection + Causal convolution
- Unidirectional LSTM (256 hidden units, 2 layers) for causal temporal encoding
- ResidualMLP blocks with layer normalization
- Output: 64-dimensional latent means (mu_x)

**Key Innovations**:
- Causal convolutions prevent future information leakage
- Depthwise separable convolutions for efficiency
- Spectral normalization for training stability

### 3. TargetEncoder
**Purpose**: Encodes target signals (scattering + phase harmonic) into variational parameters.

**Architecture**:
- Dual-modal processing for scattering and phase harmonic inputs
- Cross-modal fusion layer combining both modalities
- Bidirectional LSTM (128 hidden units, 3 layers) for rich temporal modeling
- Outputs: mu_y (64-dim) and logvar_y (128-dim split into prior and conditional features)

**Advanced Features**:
- Separate processing paths for each modality before fusion
- Bidirectional LSTM captures forward and backward dependencies
- Larger logvar output enables flexible posterior modeling

### 4. ConditionalEncoder
**Purpose**: Implements q(z|x,y) - the posterior distribution conditioned on both inputs.

**Architecture**:
- Simple ResidualMLP taking concatenated source and target features
- Outputs posterior parameters (mu_post, logvar_post)
- Enables the TEB framework's conditional modeling capability

### 5. Decoder
**Purpose**: Generates future predictions for both scattering and phase harmonic signals.

**Architecture**:
- Multi-path TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network) processing
