r"""Lint for the one arm: a single axis, a closed inventory, and a stride that follows the horizon.

This package ships **one** arm, and the omission is a decision rather than an oversight. The floor,
horizon and depth arms answer questions about the target domain, which
``teb_vae/lag_attn_cfs/configs`` already asks; the encoder arms answer questions about the encoder,
which ``teb_vae/lag_attn_transformer_rws/configs`` already asks. The tiling arm is the only one whose
answer could differ between the two encoders, because what it moves is the per-step gradient noise --
$152$ decoded anchors against $\approx 10.1$ -- and a pre-normalised attention stack is exactly the
architecture whose stability is sensitive to that.

These tests are a lint, not a fit. They exist so a malformed arm is caught on the development box --
a key that does not resolve, a stray second delta, a stride left behind by a horizon change, a file
nobody declared -- rather than days into a production run.
